# Classification of Reuters dataset

R8 dataset from Reuters classification with the help of LSTM

## Steps to run the code.

1.Run the setup.py file using the following command

`python setup.py`
  
`Note`: If you are not able to run the above file, do the following:
        Download the google news vectors from [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM&export=download)<br>
        Place them in a folder named <em> Google_News_vectors </em> in the current directory<br>
        Download the training data from [here](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~smimarog/textmining/datasets/r8-train-stemmed.txt)<br>
        Download the testing dataset from [here](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~smimarog/textmining/datasets/r8-test-stemmed.txt)<br>
        Place both the files in a folder named <em> Dataset </em> in the current directory<br>

2.Run lstm.py after successfully download the google news vectors and the r8 dataset.

`python lstm.py`
  
3.Inspect the output.csv file generated for results.The result will be shown on the console also.
